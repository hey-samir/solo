# Development Context for Next Session

## Current Status
- Version: 2.1.0
- Authentication: Partially implemented with Clerk
  - Basic middleware setup complete
  - Role-based access control initialized
  - Frontend routes protected

## Remaining Auth Tasks
1. Complete Clerk Integration
   - Verify session handling
   - Implement user profile management
   - Set up role synchronization
   - Test authentication flows

2. Testing Requirements
   - Sign-up flow validation
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Protected route access
   - Role-based permissions
   - Session persistence
   - Error handling scenarios

## Environment Configuration
- Clerk keys configured:
  - VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY (Frontend)
  - CLERK_SECRET_KEY (Backend)
- Staging environment on port 5000
- Production ready for port 3000

## Next Steps
1. Auth Flow Implementation
   - Complete user session management
   - Add profile data synchronization
   - Implement role-based middleware tests
   - Add comprehensive error handling

2. Testing Phase
   - Validate all authentication endpoints
   - Test protected route behavior
   - Verify role-based access
   - Check session management
   - Document testing results

3. User Experience
   - Add loading states during auth
   - Implement proper error messages
   - Add success notifications
   - Ensure mobile-responsive auth forms

## Component Migration Plan
1. Replace Deprecated AuthContext:
   - Remove src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
   - Implement Clerk hooks across components

2. Update Components:
   - Settings.tsx: Migrate useAuth to Clerk's useUser
   - Profile.tsx: Update authentication checks
   - Solo.tsx: Implement new auth flow
   - Pricing.tsx: Fix isAuthenticated usage

3. Type Updates:
   - Add proper Clerk types
   - Update User interface
   - Fix LSP errors in components

## Questions for Next Session
1. Should we implement additional auth features beyond the basic Clerk integration?
2. Are there specific role-based access patterns needed for the climbing features?
3. What level of user profile customization should we enable?
4. Do we need to implement any special auth flows for the mobile experience?
