          <AccordionItem
            question="How do I log a climb?"
            answer="To log a route, tap the '+' button in the navigation bar. Fill in the details about your route including the color, grade, and whether it was a Send or a Try. Routes are tracked as either Sends (successful completions) or Tries (unsuccessful attempts)."
          />
          <AccordionItem
            question="What's the difference between a Send and a Try?"
            answer="A 'Send' means you successfully completed the route from start to finish without falling. A 'Try' is when you attempted the route but didn't complete it. Both are valuable to track as they show your progress over time."
          />
          <AccordionItem
            question="How are points calculated?"
            answer="Points are calculated based on the difficulty of the route and whether you sent it or not. A Send earns you 10 points multiplied by your star rating, while Tries earn 5 points multiplied by your star rating. This system rewards both successful completions and the effort put into attempting challenging routes."
          />
          <AccordionItem
            question="What do the stats metrics mean?"
            answer={`Your statistics show various aspects of your climbing progress:
• Send Rate: The percentage of successful sends out of total routes attempted
• Average Grade: The typical difficulty level you climb
• Points: Your overall achievement score based on your routes
• Sessions: Groups of routes climbed within the same timeframe
• Star Rating: Your performance rating based on successful sends`}
          />
          <AccordionItem
            question="What are the dimensions of a Send?"
            answer={`When logging a Send, you'll record:
• Grade: The difficulty rating of the route
• Color: The hold color used for the route
• Type: Whether it's a Send (success) or Try (attempt)
• Stars: Your rating of the route quality
• Date: When you climbed the route
• Session: Which climbing session it belongs to`}
