# Next Development Session: Environment Management & Build System Improvements

## Context from Previous Session (2.1.1)
- Enhanced port management and logging for staging environment
- Improved deployment process reliability
- Added detailed startup validation
- Environment-specific port configuration (5000 for staging)

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Environment Validation Completion
Key tasks:
- Implement build validation steps to ensure correct artifact generation
- Add environment-specific secrets validation
- Create deployment readiness checks
- Develop environment verification tests
Focus on: Creating a robust validation pipeline that prevents invalid deployments

### 2. Build System Enhancements
Priority tasks:
- Implement build caching for faster deployments
- Add build artifact validation
- Setup build performance monitoring
- Create build status reporting
Focus on: Improving build reliability and performance

### 3. Deployment Improvements
Required features:
- Add rollback capabilities
- Implement zero-downtime deployments
- Add comprehensive health checks
- Create deployment audit logs
Focus on: Ensuring smooth deployments with fallback options

## Future Work (Not for This Session)
Error Handling Pipeline (Phase 2):
- Unified error handling system with climbing themes
- Error component cleanup and standardization
- Structured logging implementation
This will be addressed in a separate development phase.

## Technical Details
Current environment structure:
```
/src
  /server
    /config
    /deployment
    /utils
```

Key files to modify:
1. src/server/config/environment.js
2. src/server/deployment/deploy.js
3. src/server/utils/port-check.js

## Questions to Address
1. Build System:
   - Should we implement build caching before or after artifact validation?
   - What metrics should we track for build performance?

2. Deployment:
   - How many previous versions should we maintain for rollbacks?
   - What criteria defines a successful deployment?

3. Validation:
   - What specific checks should be included in the deployment readiness validation?
   - How should we handle partial validation failures?

## Getting Started
1. Begin with implementing build validation steps
2. Progress to deployment readiness checks
3. Finally, add build caching and performance monitoring

## Notes
- Keep the existing authentication system untouched during these changes
- Maintain backward compatibility with current deployment processes
- Document all new validation steps and deployment procedures

## Remaining Auth Tasks
1. Complete Clerk Integration
   - Verify session handling
   - Implement user profile management
   - Set up role synchronization
   - Test authentication flows

2. Testing Requirements
   - Sign-up flow validation
   - Login/logout functionality
   - Protected route access
   - Role-based permissions
   - Session persistence
   - Error handling scenarios

## Component Migration Plan
1. Replace Deprecated AuthContext:
   - Remove src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx
   - Implement Clerk hooks across components

2. Update Components:
   - Settings.tsx: Migrate useAuth to Clerk's useUser
   - Profile.tsx: Update authentication checks
   - Solo.tsx: Implement new auth flow
   - Pricing.tsx: Fix isAuthenticated usage

3. Type Updates:
   - Add proper Clerk types
   - Update User interface
   - Fix LSP errors in components

## Questions for Next Session
1. Should we implement additional auth features beyond the basic Clerk integration?
2. Are there specific role-based access patterns needed for the climbing features?
3. What level of user profile customization should we enable?
4. Do we need to implement any special auth flows for the mobile experience?
