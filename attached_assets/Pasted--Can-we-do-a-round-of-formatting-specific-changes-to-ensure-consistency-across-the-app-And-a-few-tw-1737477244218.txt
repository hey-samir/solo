Can we do a round of formatting specific changes to ensure consistency across the app? And a few tweks to the css file while we're at it?

Things I want to standardize:

There's a big space between the start of containers and the topnav. Can we remove that?
Some containers like "Profile" have a bg-card background instead of taking bg-primary. Can you adjust?
The tables in Standings and Sessions are too wide for the 6" viewport and require horizontal scrolling. Please reduce padding/margin in the columns and/or reduce font so that there is never horizontal scrolling required at any viewport BUT we're always able to see the full table
When some buttons are active in the bottom navbar, they have a purple background and the icon disappears. Can we standardize thihs so when buttons are pressed, they just get an active indicator below the icon, but nothing else changes?
Column 1 of "Sends" is too narrow. Can you increase it so the text never has to wrap? You should reduce Column 2 accordingly so there's no spillover
Can you make the secondary button colkor the slider-track color? I need a little more contrast with the card
Can you make the 3 buttons in Profile fit on the same row? Feel free to reduce padding a bit so that works
Can you move the "Start Free" buttons in Solo Pro pricing page to below the table and make them buttons with the button-primary-bg?
Can you make the KPIs in Profile fit 3 per row? Right now it's just one per row
The hamburger menu has a lot of space between the top and the first menu item. Can you reduce that a bit?
The buttons in "Stats" have the wrong background color. Should be bg-primary
In Trends, the chart titles should use text-primary for the color
(custom CSS file changes): I notice that pro-badge, slider-track, nav-pills, nav-link.active, feedback-submit, table thead th.sortable:hover, profile-button, signup-btn, edit-photo-icon, and a couple other places define colors when in fact they should just reference the colors we've already defined up top
